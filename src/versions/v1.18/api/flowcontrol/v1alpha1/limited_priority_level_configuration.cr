  # LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits. It addresses two issues:
  #  * How are requests for this priority level limited?
  #  * What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?
  class Api::Flowcontrol::V1alpha1::LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration < Kubernetes::Spec
    # `assuredConcurrencyShares` (ACS) configures the execution limit, which is a limit on the number of requests of this priority level that may be exeucting at a given time.  ACS must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:
    #
    #             ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )
    #
    # bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL). This field has a default value of 30.
